# jax-theme

hello! i'm jax and this is my personal vs-code theme!

![example_image](images/example_2.png)

the theme colours are based on the following:

- [green earth](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/green-earth/) - a firefox theme by Rhea
- [obsidian-typewriter](https://github.com/crashmoney/obsidian-typewriter) - an obsidian theme by [crashmoney](https://github.com/crashmoney)

dark themes are nice, but sometimes it can get a little depressing :( 

hopefully this theme makes you feel cozy and at home! <3
